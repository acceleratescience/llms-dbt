    "# Managing State in LLM Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) are inherently **stateless** - each API call is independent and unaware of previous interactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, building practical applications often requires maintaining state: tracking conversation history, monitoring costs, measuring performance, and managing system resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we'll explore how to effectively manage state in LLM applications. We'll start with simple patterns for tracking conversations and build up to more sophisticated approaches that can scale to complex applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why State Matters\n",
    "Consider a simple chatbot. While it might seem like you're having a continuous conversation, behind the scenes each message is a separate API call. Without explicitly managing state, your application would:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Forget previous messages in the conversation\n",
    "- Have no way to track costs or token usage\n",
    "- Lack visibility into system performance\n",
    "- Be unable to debug issues effectively\n",
    "\n",

    "Getting up and running with the OpenAI API is simple. First, an API key is required. To get started with an API key, you'll need to sign up for an account on the OpenAI website.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the duration of this course, **we'll provide you with an API key**, and a set amount of credits that should be enough to run the materials in this course several times - so you should hopefully be able to experiment with different prompts if you wanted to for example!\n",
    "\n",
    "_**Note**: Please do let us know if you run into any issues with this, and we'll be very happy to support._\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Storing your API key\n",
    "For your future work with OpenAI's APIs, we would recommend storing the API key in an `.env` file for example, and not sharing it with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your environment, when you import the OpenAI library, it will automatically search your environment for the API key. More specifically, it will look for an environment variable called `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or search for a file such as `.env`, and look for the key there. The sample code below illustrates this:\n",

      "### Christianity\n",
      "In Christianity, the purpose of life is often understood in terms of relationship with God. Key elements include:\n",
      "- **Loving God and Others**: The greatest commandments, as taught by Jesus, emphasize loving God and loving one's neighbor (Matthew 22:37-39). This love is central to Christian life.\n",
      "- **Salvation and Eternal Life**: Many Christians believe that the ultimate purpose is to seek salvation through faith in Jesus Christ, leading to eternal life with God (John 3:16).\n",
      "- **Service and Discipleship**: Followers are called to serve others, spread the teachings of Christ (the Great Commission), and live according to biblical teachings.\n",

      "- **Submission to Allah**: The term \"Islam\" itself means submission, and living a life in accordance with Allah’s will is considered paramount.\n",
      "- **Good Deeds and Righteousness**: Engaging in good deeds, helping others, and following the Five Pillars of Islam (faith, prayer, fasting, almsgiving, pilgrimage) are ways to fulfill one’s purpose.\n",
      "- **Accountability and Afterlife**: Muslims believe in the Day of Judgment, where each individual's actions will be assessed, influencing their eternal destination.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Buddhism\n",
      "Buddhism offers a unique perspective that does not center around a deity but emphasizes personal spiritual development:\n",
      "- **Achieving Enlightenment**: The ultimate purpose is to attain Nirvana, a state free from suffering and the cycle of rebirth (samsara). This involves understanding the Four Noble Truths and following the Eightfold Path.\n",
      "- **Compassion and Wisdom**: Central to Buddhist practice is the cultivation of compassion (karuna) and wisdom (prajna) towards oneself and others.\n",

Different cultures, religions, and philosophies offer varied perspectives on what constitutes the purpose of life. Here are a few interpretations:\\n\\n1. **Religious Perspectives**: Many religions suggest that the purpose of life is to serve a higher power, follow moral guidelines, and seek an afterlife or spiritual enlightenment. For example, in Christianity, it might involve loving God and others; in Buddhism, achieving enlightenment and relieving suffering is emphasized.\\n\\n2. **Philosophical Views**: Philosophers have pondered the purpose of life from various angles. Existentialists like Jean-Paul Sartre suggest that life has no inherent meaning, and it is up to each individual to create their own purpose. In contrast, utilitarianism promotes the idea of maximizing happiness and reducing suffering as key goals.\\n\\n3. **Personal Fulfillment**: For many people, the purpose of life may center around personal fulfillment, including pursuing passions, building meaningful relationships, and contributing positively to society. This perspective emphasizes individual experiences and the pursuit of happiness.\\n\\n4. **Biological Perspective**: From a scientific standpoint, one could argue that the purpose of life is to survive, reproduce, and pass on genetic material to future generations, in line with evolutionary principles.\\n\\n5. **Cultural Narratives**: Different cultures might emphasize community, family, and tradition, suggesting that the purpose of life is found within collective experiences and contributions to society.\\n\\nUltimately, the purpose of life is subjective and varies from person to person. Many people find meaning through a combination of these perspectives, engaging in self-discovery to define what is significant to them.'</span>\n",

Point 1 refers to religious perspectives on the purpose of life, which can vary significantly across different faiths. Here’s a deeper exploration of how some of the major world religions frame the purpose of life:\\n\\n### Christianity\\nIn Christianity, the purpose of life is often understood in terms of relationship with God. Key elements include:\\n- **Loving God and Others**: The greatest commandments, as taught by Jesus, emphasize loving God and loving one\\'s neighbor (Matthew 22:37-39). This love is central to Christian life.\\n- **Salvation and Eternal Life**: Many Christians believe that the ultimate purpose is to seek salvation through faith in Jesus Christ, leading to eternal life with God (John 3:16).\\n- **Service and Discipleship**: Followers are called to serve others, spread the teachings of Christ (the Great Commission), and live according to biblical teachings.\\n\\n### Islam\\nIn Islam, the purpose of life is to worship Allah (God) and live according to His guidance as revealed through the Quran and the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad. Key aspects include:\\n- **Submission to Allah**: The term \"Islam\" itself means submission, and living a life in accordance with Allah’s will is considered paramount.\\n- **Good Deeds and Righteousness**: Engaging in good deeds, helping others, and following the Five Pillars of Islam (faith, prayer, fasting, almsgiving, pilgrimage) are ways to fulfill one’s purpose.\\n- **Accountability and Afterlife**: Muslims believe in the Day of Judgment, where each individual\\'s actions will be assessed, influencing their eternal destination.\\n\\n### Buddhism\\nBuddhism offers a unique perspective that does not center around a deity but emphasizes personal spiritual development:\\n- **Achieving Enlightenment**: The ultimate purpose is to attain Nirvana, a state free from suffering and the cycle of rebirth (samsara). This involves understanding the Four Noble Truths and following the Eightfold Path.\\n- **Compassion and Wisdom**: Central to Buddhist practice is the cultivation of compassion (karuna) and wisdom (prajna) towards oneself and others.\\n\\n### Hinduism\\nHinduism presents multiple paths and purposes for life, often tied to concepts like Dharma, Karma, and Moksha:\\n- **Dharma**: Fulfilling one\\'s duties and responsibilities in life (dharma) is seen as essential, contributing to social order and personal integrity.\\n- **Karma**: The actions one takes (karma) affect future lives, creating a moral framework for life decisions.\\n- **Moksha**: The ultimate goal is to achieve Moksha, or liberation from the cycle of birth and rebirth, uniting the individual soul (Atman) with the ultimate reality (Brahman).\\n\\n### Judaism\\nIn Judaism, the purpose of life is often seen in the context of covenant and ethical living:\\n- **Covenantal Relationship**: Jews believe they have a special covenant with God, and fulfilling the commandments (mitzvot) is a way to honor this relationship.\\n- **Repairing the World (Tikkun Olam)**: Engaging in social justice and improving the world is a significant aspect of Jewish life and purpose.\\n\\n### New Age and Spiritual Movements\\nThese often blend various religious philosophies and emphasize personal growth, self-awareness, and the interconnectedness of all beings. Purpose may be seen as:\\n- **Personal Growth and Healing**: Focusing on achieving higher states of consciousness, self-fulfillment, and spiritual awakening.\\n- **Service to Humanity**: Many in these movements feel called to serve and contribute to the well-being of others and the planet.\\n\\nIn summary, religious perspectives on the purpose of life can include serving a higher power, fulfilling moral and ethical obligations, seeking spiritual enlightenment, and striving for a harmonious relationship with oneself and others. Each tradition offers unique teachings and practices that guide followers in their quest for meaning and purpose.'</span>\n",
