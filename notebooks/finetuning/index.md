# Fine tuning

In this section we look at how to fine-tune LLMs. We do this in two ways:

1. Fine-tuning OpenAI models. Sticking with the OpenAI theme, we will introduce how to use the OpenAI API to set up and run fine tuning jobs.
2. Open source models. Hugging Face offers the ability to download and run local models. We will look at how to fine-tune base models on a single GPU and how to use distributed training to fine-tune on multiple GPUs.
